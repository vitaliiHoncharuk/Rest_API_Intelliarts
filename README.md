### Steps to run the application : 

You need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [mongodb database](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) installed on your computer.
#### Start
Open IDE with project, run commands one by one in terminal (path should be equal to main project folder)

#### Settings 
Make sure mongodb is running on port 27017 (by default), else in app.js line - 6 you can change to port it's running. 
Same to node. Default port is 3000, make sure it's free.


#### Finally
```npm
npm init --y
npm install 
```

Now run
```javascript
node app.js
```

In console you should see "Listening", which means server is running. Go to web-browser , and find app on 
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
